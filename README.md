Starter Files for FEWD Hot or Cold Project by Thinkful

In the final assignment for this lesson, you're going use your knowledge of functions and jQuery to build a "Hot or Cold" game. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess – “hot” if their guess was close, and “cold” if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they’ll have the option to start a new game.

For this project, you will be supplyed with HTML and CSS files for the app, and you’ll only be responsible for writing the JavaScript that brings these static files to life.
